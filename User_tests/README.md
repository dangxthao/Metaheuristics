Some User Tests in Breach
====

In this folder, I have added some model examples to better show some problems that we are facing while designing models, properties or systems in Breach.


Contents
----

1. A folder named `Bug_1` which contains files regarding an identified Breach bug. It concerns nested functions.
2. A folder named `Sample_Model` which contains the files of a watertank model that we are working on.
	1. `STL_stabilization_property.m` (main function)
	2. `specs_stabilization.stl` (text file used to define the STL formulas, the variable name is Ï†) 
	3. `watertank_STL_test.slx` (Simulink model)


Requirements
---

- Matlab
- Simulink
- Deep Learning Toolbox

No other toolbox is needed to run the script.
