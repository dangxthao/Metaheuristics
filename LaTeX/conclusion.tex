\section{Conclusion}
We have presented a new falsification algorithm based on a combination of existing metaheuristics.
The combination is guided to enhance both exploitation performance, measured by robustness, and exploration performance measured by coverage.
This allows the falsification algorithm to converge faster while being able to escape local optima. 
We demonstrated the efficiency of the new algorithm by falsifying
properties on a number of benchmarks, for which that this algorithm outperformed some existing algorithms. Ongoing work includes considering other classes of input signals, in particular signals that are subject to temporal constraints. A more long-term goal involves 
investigating the usage of other coverage measures, such as combinatorial entropy.
