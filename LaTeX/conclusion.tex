To conclude, we have presented a new falsification algorithm based on a combination of different metaheuristics that exploits their complementary properties. It also integrates a method for timed pattern generation to better handle input signal spaces subject to temporal constraints.
The metaheuristics combination is guided to enhance both exploitation performance, measured by robustness, and exploration performance measured by coverage. This allows the falsification algorithm to converge faster while being able to escape local optima. 
We demonstrated the efficiency of the new algorithm by falsifying
properties on a number of benchmarks, for which this algorithm outperformed some existing algorithms. Ongoing work includes considering the usage of other coverage measures, such as combinatorial entropy.
